## Last Week's Accomplishments

> After late's website got a semi-remodel on the different names of the various pages, I refactored the current tab-layout
> to reflect the same results. I also imported the same icons for use in the LATE mobile application from Font Awesome.
> This way, consistency is maintained across both the web and iOS application.

## This Week's Plan

> This upcoming week I plan to progress the iOS storyboard to reflect the same icons as the LATE website (as of now the various
> SVGs are imported, but not yet implemented). I also hope to customize on the top and bottom toolbars for the application.

## Anything Blocking?

> No.

## Notes

> Not applicable.
