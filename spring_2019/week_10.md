## Last Week's Accomplishments

> After late's website got a semi-remodel on the different names of the various pages, I refactored the current tab-layout
> to reflect the same results. I also imported the same icons for use in the LATE mobile application from Font Awesome.
> This way, consistency is maintained across both the web and iOS application. ![Icons Added](https://snag.gy/qvtTCy.jpg)

## This Week's Plan

> This upcoming week I plan to progress the iOS storyboard to reflect the same icons as the LATE website (as of now the various
> SVGs are imported, but not yet implemented). I also hope to customize on the top and bottom toolbars for the application.

## Anything Blocking?

> No.

## Notes

> In the future, I will need to take into consideration the credit for giving using Font Awesome's images. This will
> likely be done in the Terms of Service or something of the like.
