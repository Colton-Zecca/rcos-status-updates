## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, we fixed up the essential issues with Zach's install of Mac OSX. Now, internet is working on his
> machine and iOS development is possible. We also touched up UI/UX concepts furthermore.

## This Week's Plan

> This upcoming week, Zach and I plan to finally start our initial project repository for the iOS application.
> We also hope to iron out some of the less-essential bugs on Zach's machine when using Mac OSX--some include 
> battery life issues and sound card issues.

## Anything Blocking?

> Now that we have Mac OSX and its essentials installed on Zach's machine, there are no current blockers.

## Notes

> Not applicable.
