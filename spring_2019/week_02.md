## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, Zach and I installed Mac OSX on his machine. We continued to learn Swift, and plan to start 
> our development in the coming weeks. We worked on UI/UX diagrams and future planning for the mobile 
> mobile implementation of L.A.T.E.

## This Week's Plan

> This upcoming week, we plan to iron out the bugs with the Mac OSX install on Zach's machine, and finalize
> some UI/UX design. Then, we should be able to begin development shortly after.

## Anything Blocking?

> May need help setting up the internet drivers on Zach's Mac OSX install, but not a blocker as of yet.

## Notes

> Not applicable.
