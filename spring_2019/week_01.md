## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I worked with setting up my developer environment for Swift development and
> setting up developer tools on Zach Love's machine--another member of L.A.T.E. We began conceptualizing some basic ideas
> for the general UX/UI of the iOS application, but haven't yet gone into much detail. Zach and I
> also networked with other members of L.A.T.E. that have previous experience with Swift development,
> and may work with them in the future.

## This Week's Plan

> This upcoming week, we (Zach and myself) plan to begin learning the basics of application development
> using Swift. We also hope to begin a skeleton project structure, and go more in depth with our UX/UI development.

## Anything Blocking?

> Struggling with setting up iOS development on Zach's Windows machine, but it doesn't appear to be a blocker
> just yet.

## Notes

> Not applicable.
